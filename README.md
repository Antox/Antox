###Compiling Antox From Source with IntelliJ IDE
- Download https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html
- In Android Studio, go to Help>Check For Updates. As of writing, the latest version of AS is 0.8.1
- In Android Studio again, go to Tools>Android>SDK Manager. Make sure you're using the latest SDK tools and SDK Build tools.
- Clone the Antox repo
- To import the project, go to File>Import Project. Select the build.gradle file in the root of the Antox folder
- Download the latest tox4j binaries from https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/tox4j-android-arm/
- Copy libtox4j.so to app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi (you will need to create some of these folders)
- Copy tox4j_2.11-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and protobuf.jar into app/libs
- These dependencies are updated from time to time, so you might need to check back if the binary link changed
- Install the Scala plugin in IntelliJ, restart, and wait for IntelliJ to set itself up
- Connect your phone in developer mode and click Run in Android Studio. It will install Antox on to your phone and run it automatically.
